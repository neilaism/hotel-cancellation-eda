# 🏨 Hotel Cancellation Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction

Hi, I'm Neila! 👋  
As part of my transition from internal auditing to data analytics, this project is one of my first explorations into solving real-world problems with data. I’ve always been interested in the hotel industry, so I built a fictional business case around a real dataset to explore what drives booking cancellations and how hotels can respond proactively.

## 📁 Repository Structure

1. `README.md` – Overview of the project  
2. `analysis_project.ipynb` – Python notebook for cleaning and EDA  
3. `hotel_bookings.csv` – Raw dataset  
4. `main_df.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for analysis

## 🧠 Problem Background

A high cancellation rate can seriously affect hotel revenue and operational planning. In this project, I aimed to:

- Identify which **customer types** and **distribution channels** are most prone to cancellation  
- Understand behavioral **patterns in bookings** (e.g., lead time, ADR, repeat guests)  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to reduce future cancellations

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Hotel Booking Demand – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)  
- **Size**: 119,390 rows | 32 columns  
- **Used**: 10 selected features (clean, no missing values)  
> Key columns: `is_canceled`, `customer_type`, `distribution_channel`, `lead_time`, `adr`, `is_repeated_guest`, etc.

## 💬 Final Notes

This is my first end-to-end data analytics project, and it's a big part of my transition into the data field. While far from perfect, I’ve learned a lot by exploring, building, and iterating.
