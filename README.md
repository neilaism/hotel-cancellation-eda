# Hotel Cancellation Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Neila! ðŸ‘‹  
As part of my journey transitioning from internal audit to data analytics, this is one of the first projects where I applied data analysis skills to a real-world dataset. Iâ€™ve always had an interest in the hotel industry, so I built a fictional business case around this dataset to explore what drives cancellation behavior.

## Problem Background
A high cancellation rate directly impacts hotel revenue. In this project, I aim to:

- **Rows**: 119,390  
- **Columns used**: 13 out of 32 (clean subset with no missing values)  
  > Includes: `is_canceled`, `customer_type`, `distribution_channel`, `lead_time`, `previous_cancellations`, `adr`, etc.

## Method
- Descriptive Statistics (EDA)
- Basic Inferential Statistics (t-test, correlation)
- Visual analysis with Tableau Dashboard

## Stacks
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools**: VSCode, Tableau, Canva
